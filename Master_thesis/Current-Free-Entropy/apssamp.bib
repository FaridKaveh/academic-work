Examples include all living organisms and their motile constituents such as molecular motors. This article reviews recent progress in applying the principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and hydrodynamics to form a systematic theory of the behavior of collections of active particles–active matter–with only minimal regard to microscopic details. A unified view of the many kinds of active matter is presented, encompassing not only living systems but inanimate analogs. Theory and experiment are discussed side by side. }

abstract = {Summary
Eggs of oviparous animals must be prepared to develop rapidly and robustly until hatching. The balance between sugars, fats, and other macromolecules must therefore be carefully considered when loading the egg with nutrients. Clearly, packing too much or too little fuel would lead to suboptimal conditions for development. While many studies have measured the overall energy utilization of embryos, little is known of the identity of the molecular-level processes that contribute to the energy budget in the first place [1]. Here, we introduce Drosophila embryos as a platform to study the energy budget of embryogenesis. We demonstrate through three orthogonal measurements — respiration, calorimetry, and biochemical assays — that Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis utilizes 10 mJ of energy generated by the oxidation of the maternal glycogen and triacylglycerol (TAG) stores (Figure 1). Normalized for mass, this is comparable to the resting metabolic rates of insects [2]. Interestingly, alongside data from earlier studies, our results imply that protein, RNA, and DNA polymerization require less than 10% of the total ATPs produced in the early embryo.}

abstract = {Summary
All living systems function out of equilibrium and exchange energy in the form of heat with their environment. Thus, heat flow can inform on the energetic costs of cellular processes, which are largely unknown. Here, we have repurposed an isothermal calorimeter to measure heat flow between developing zebrafish embryos and the surrounding medium. Heat flow increased over time with cell number. Unexpectedly, a prominent oscillatory component of the heat flow, with periods matching the synchronous early reductive cleavage divisions, persisted even when DNA synthesis and mitosis were blocked by inhibitors. Instead, the heat flow oscillations were driven by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions catalyzed by the cell-cycle oscillator, the biochemical network controlling mitotic entry and exit. We propose that the high energetic cost of cell-cycle signaling reflects the significant thermodynamic burden of imposing accurate and robust timing on cell proliferation during development.}

In this work we study RnT motion with diffusion in a harmonic potential in one dimension via a path integral approach. We derive a Doi-Peliti field theory and use it to calculate the entropy production and other observables in closed form. All our results are exact.}
